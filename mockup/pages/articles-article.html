			<h3>Advice on Building a Press List</h3>
			<div class="time">July 22, 2014</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>It surprises me how many companies don’t keep a press list (also known as a media list). It’s honestly one of the most important things you can do for your business no matter what size you’re at. Ironically, it’s even more important for smaller indie studios, yet these are the very people that often don’t have them.</p>
				<p>Just to clarify, a press list is exactly what is sounds like: a list of journalists, along with their contact info and the publication they work for.</p>
				<p>Keeping an up-to-date press list gives you an easy way to reach out to the media every time you launch a new product or update. Sure there are PR firms or PR mailing services you could use, but they cost a lot and are usually not as effective as if you take the time to do it yourself. Just think, if you were a journalist would you rather speak to the creator of the product, or a PR firm that has very little insight into how or why the product was made?</p>
				<p>You shouldn’t underestimate the importance of having good media coverage, it’s one of the key components to helping propel your app up the charts at launch. It can often be even more effective than being featured by Apple, especially if the feature isn’t at the top centre of the App Store.</p>
				<h4>Getting Started</h4>
				<p>The easiest way to keep track of your press contacts is in a spreadsheet. I try to avoid spreadsheets as much as possible, but for keeping a press list I’ve still not found anything better. I use Numbers.app from Apple but feel free to use whatever works for you — I’ve looked for an online service to manage these contacts but they are all overly complex and come with a monthly subscription fee. Unless you do marketing full time, I’d say it’s best to stick with a spreadsheet, as it’s free and easy to manage.</p>
				<p>A basic press list should contain the following columns: Publication, Website, Type, Name, Position, Email, and Notes. This is obviously not set in stone, you can add and remove columns depending on your needs. For example you could include space for a Twitter handle or a column for sent promo codes.</p>

				<p>I’ve placed some example data in the above example just to make it very clear what each column is used for (you’ll need to do the work to find the email addresses yourself). The Notes column is useful to keep track of coverage and responses. For example, it’s worth noting if a publication has covered you in the past or never responds to your emails.
